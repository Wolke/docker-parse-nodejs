The\n\t * most common use case is finding all objects that match a query through the\n\t * <code>find</code> method. For example, this sample code fetches all objects\n\t * of class <code>MyClass</code>. It calls a different function depending on\n\t * whether the fetch succeeded or not.\n\t *\n\t * <pre>\n\t * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n\t * query.find({\n\t *   success: function(results) {\n\t *     // results is an array of Parse.Object.\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t *   error: function(error) {\n\t *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n\t *   }\n\t * });</pre></p>\n\t *\n\t * <p>A Parse.Query can also be used to retrieve a single object whose id is\n\t * known, through the get method. For example, this sample code fetches an\n\t * object of class <code>MyClass</code> and id <code>myId</code>. It calls a\n\t * different function depending on whether the fetch succeeded or not.\n\t *\n\t * <pre>\n\t * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n\t * query.get(myId, {\n\t *   success: function(object) {\n\t *     // object is an instance of Parse.Object.\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t *   error: function(object, error) {\n\t *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n\t *   }\n\t * });</pre></p>\n\t *\n\t * <p>A Parse.Query can also be used to count the number of objects that match\n\t * the query without retrieving all of those objects. For example, this\n\t * sample code counts the number of objects of the class <code>MyClass</code>\n\t * <pre>\n\t * var query = new Parse.Query(MyClass);\n\t * query.count({\n\t *   success: function(number) {\n\t *     // There are number instances of MyClass.\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t *   error: function(error) {\n\t *     // error is an instance of Parse.Error.\n\t *   }\n\t * });</pre></p>\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ParseQuery = function () {\n\t  function ParseQuery(objectClass) {\n\t    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, ParseQuery);\n\t\n\t    if (typeof objectClass === 'string') {\n\t      if (objectClass === 'User' && _CoreManager2.default.get('PERFORM_USER_REWRITE')) {\n\t        this.className = '_User';\n\t      } else {\n\t        this.className = objectClass;\n\t      }\n\t    } else if (objectClass instanceof _ParseObject2.default) {\n\t      this.className = objectClass.className;\n\t    } else if (typeof objectClass === 'function') {\n\t      if (typeof objectClass.className === 'string') {\n\t        this.className = objectClass.className;\n\t      } else {\n\t        var obj = new objectClass();\n\t        this.className = obj.className;\n\t      }\n\t    } else {\n\t      throw new TypeError('A ParseQuery must be constructed with a ParseObject or class name.');\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    this._where = {};\n\t    this._include = [];\n\t    this._limit = -1; // negative limit is not sent in the server request\n\t    this._skip = 0;\n\t    this._extraOptions = {};\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Adds constraint that at least one of the passed in queries matches.\n\t   * @method _orQuery\n\t   * @param {Array} queries\n\t   * @return {Parse.Query} Returns the query, so you can chain this call.\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  (0, _createClass3.default)(ParseQuery, [{\n\t    key: '_orQuery',\n\t    value: function (queries) {\n\t      var queryJSON = queries.map(function (q) {\n\t        return q.toJSON().where;\n\t      });\n\t\n\t      this._where.$or = queryJSON;\n\t      return this;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Helper for condition queries\n\t     */\n\t\n\t  }, {\n\t    key: '_addCondition',\n\t    value: function (key, condition, value) {\n\t      if (!this._where[key] || typeof this._where[key] === 'string') {\n\t        this._where[key] = {};\n\t      }\n\t      this._where[key][condition] = (0, _encode2.default)(value, false, true);\n\t      return this;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns a JSON representation of this query.\n\t     * @method toJSON\n\t     * @return {Object} The JSON representation of the query.\n\t     */\n\t\n\t  }, {\n\t    key: 'toJSON',\n\t    value: function () {\n\t      var params = {\n\t        where: this._where\n\t      };\n\t\n\t      if (this._include.length) {\n\t        params.include = this._include.join(',');\n\t      }\n\t      if (this._select) {\n\t        params.keys = this._select.join(',');\n\t      }\n\t      if (this._limit >= 0) {\n\t        params.limit = this._limit;\n\t      }\n\t      if (this._skip > 0) {\n\t        params.skip = this._skip;\n\t      }\n\t      if (this._order) {\n\t        params.order = this._order.join(',');\n\t      }\n\t      for (var key in this._extraOptions) {\n\t        params[key] = this._extraOptions[key];\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      return params;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Constructs a Parse.Object whose id is already known by fetching data from\n\t     * the server.
